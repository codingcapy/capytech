                    <p class="py-2">Posted on: April 10, 2023</p>
                    <p class="py-2">I recently had the honor of becoming a certified Professional Scrum Master I from
                        Scrum.org.
                        Since then, I onboarded on my first scrum project for an art gallery web app. </p>
                    <p class="py-2"> My customer took on the role of Product Owner and Developer (tester). I took on the
                        role as
                        Scrum Master and Developer.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">We began with the Scrum Planning ceremony and established the Product Goal.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">We then came up with user stories and user acceptance criteria for each story, and I
                        assigned
                        story points
                        for each while my customer assigned priorities for them. The user stories were then added to
                        the product backlog</p>
                    <p class="py-2">I then created the Sprint backlog for the first sprint. I broke down the user
                        stories into
                        tasks, assigned story points for each, and my customer labelled the priorities for each
                        feature.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">I then created the burndown charts for the project and the sprint. The timeline was
                        tight as
                        this product was to be live in three weeks.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">As the project progressed, it seemed we were able to accomplish the most critical
                        and
                        essential features of the app. My customer was happy with the outcome within just over a
                        week after the project launched, or by the end of the first sprint.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Through this experience, I once again was able to appreciate the motivation,
                        satisfaction,
                        and velocity that agile and the scrum
                        framework provides to customers and developers alike via successful project completion.</p>
