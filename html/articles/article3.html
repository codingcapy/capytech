                    <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
                    <img src="../image/chatgpt.jpg" alt="ChatGPT" class="scrum-img">
                    <p>Posted on: April 12, 2023</p>
                    <p>I'm going to start by being honest and declaring that I do use chatGPT's or its variants's
                        help on a regular basis when I develop software (I'm going to refer to all versions of
                        OpenAI's machine learning chat software as chatGPT going forward for simplicity).</p>
                    <p>In fact, it's almost foolish to refuse using such a useful tool when it is at your
                        disposal. Asking it to build an entire software at its current state and performance is
                        unfeasible; however, asking it for a solution to a complex feature implementation or
                        squashing of a tricky bug can sometimes help. ChatGPT saves time and energy for all
                        developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ontop of that, some the solutions that it provides are clever and efficient;
                        studying these solutions elevates the developer's knowledge and skill as we become able to
                        implement the same technique in similar situations in the future.
                        Other times, it fails to provide code that completely solves a particular issue despite
                        providing it with high context, but its solution or snippets of its code can assist in
                        implementing a feature or fixing a bug.</p>
                    <p>OpenAI's chat software is rocking the world. Tech giants are shaken by its presence and
                        are scrambling to develop a competing or superior product at the risk of becoming engulfed
                        by it over time. The race has begun.</p>
                    <p>In fact, tech giants are not the only ones troubled by the software; along with the rest of
                        the tech population (as well as people in other industries), I am worried about its capacity
                        to replace my current growing field of expertise.</p>
                    <p>Given the current state of the tech industry, it seems that this chat software only
                        exacerbates the probability of someone successfully obtaining or keeping employment in the
                        tech industry.</p>
                    <p>At this point, I can only think of one solution: continute to learn and grow our expertise
                        and knowledge. The chat software's ability to learn will inevitably surpass the rate at
                        which us humans amass knowledge and experience. But the fact that we are facing a losing
                        race does not justify forfeiting it and complaining about the state of the world; the onset
                        of mainstream AI software was an inevitabile occurence. It is up to us to adapt to our
                        changing environments.</p>
