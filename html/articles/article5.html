                    <h2 class="text-4xl text-center py-10">Frameworks, Modules and Packages</h2>

                    <p class="py-2 text-teal-300">Posted on: January 10, 2024</p>
                    <p class="py-2">There's a lot of conflicting opinions among engineers out there about the use of web frameworks,
                        modules
                        and
                        libraries.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The main arguments of those on the opposing camp raise concerns over bloating the web and
                        unnecessarily complicating things that don't need to be complicated. Although they have a point,
                        there's a reason frameworks and modules like React, Next, Remix, Angular, Vue, Tailwind, Express
                        and Bun
                        have taken over the web development industry.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">I recently returned to using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS after several months of using React, Node,
                        Express, Tailwind and Next. To be honest, it didn't feel too bad; I just had to work on html
                        tags instead of jsx and tsx, and had to implement logic and axios api calls in my js files
                        instead of inside my
                        jsx and tsx components. Back to the good ol' days. I did get annoyed at having to use vanilla
                        css and scss, so I just
                        converted my
                        styling to tailwind. No regrets there.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">The Convenience Factor</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">And then once my project was done I returned to using React and Next, and realized it took me 3
                        times longer developping
                        in vanilla than when I
                        was using these frameworks and reusable components, while adding logic to my jsx without having
                        to toggle back and forth between my html and javascript. There's definitely a convenience factor
                        there, and it triples development speed.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">A question of performance?</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">Development environment aside, I was convinced that my vanilla project would have
                        advantages over my MERN apps with regards to SEO and rendering speed. But when I visited my
                        site and began navigating through its pages, the rendering took LONGER than my SPA apps most of
                        the time
                        because I was essentially sending a GET request for an entirely new page to be rendered on my
                        browser at every navigation link anchor.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">With regards to SEO, Next's SSR and replication of the file-based system of navigation takes care
                        of what lacks in the issue with React's initially empty html and client side having to fetch the
                        massive js bundle build and render every single component on the browser. The only gripe I have with Next is its
                        relentless attempt at trying to hide server request and response in the name of "serverless",
                        complicating things with auth and user state, but that's another story for another time.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Abstractions, abstractions, abstractions</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">So it seems at this point that frameworks and modules add development convenience and even
                        performance improvements at some level in exchange for "bloating the web". But there is also
                        another issue: abstraction levels. With all the magic going on under the hood, the risk of the
                        developer running into a fatal bug and not being able to find a solution goes up. Essentially,
                        they may need to dig through the documentation and source code - if available - and must have a
                        very deep understanding of low-level programming in order to fix the potential bug.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">So is the solution going back to vanilla and work 3 times slower than during the good ol'
                        framework days? Perhaps, but what will likely happen is that the developer will end up
                        engineering a "custom framework", which may or may not be more optimal than the current
                        open-source ones. And that may in turn to lead to another new, "better" open-source framework for
                        the rest of us to use. Or, go the other way and present more problems because every company/team/individual is using their own custom framework.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">What choice do I have?</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">Which leads to the next problem: developers continue to share more and more open-source
                        frameworks and there are so many options to choose from, and each and every one of them
                        continues to add updates and improvements. ThePrimeagen repeatedly advises devs to avoid
                        becoming a "React Developer", or a framework developer. Although I understand his point and the
                        importance of being a fundamentally good engineer at the core level, the reality is that
                        companies look at developer tech stacks when hiring them. So here we are today, sitting down and worrying about whether we should learn Rust, Go, Bun, Ruby on Rails, Django, Flask, Springboot, Vue, Angular, React, Next, Nuxt, Tailwind, Redux, Zustand, JWT, Passport, ChartJS, Multer, Busboy, prisma, mongoose...</p>
