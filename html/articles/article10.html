                    <p class="py-5">If you play your cards right, it might not take as long as you think.
                    </p>
                    <p>Of course, the standard path is:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>1. Be good at math at school</li>
                        <li>2. Enroll in university in a bachelor of science program majoring in computer science</li>
                        <li>3. Grind leetCode, make a portfolio website, be active on github</li>
                        <li>4. Do some co-op (or just) internships</li>
                        <li>5. Get hired as a junior.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="py-5">So, 4 years, give or take.
                    </p>
                    <p>OR, if you are a genius programmer, become self-taught, master all the skills and
                        gather all the knowledge. Contribute to some open-source projects, make a name for yourself and
                        get hired. Good luck! Or is there another way?
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-5 text-teal-300">6 Months</h2>
                    <p class="">I've seen it a million times. Bootcamps promising you the world. "Become a programmer in
                        6 months!". All that bullshit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-5">But is it?</p>
                    <p>Let's break it down: what is a programmer? A programmer is anyone who writes code to
                        build/maintain/update software. Can you become a programmer in 6 months? Of course you can! In
                        fact, you can become a programmer in a couple of hours, as long as you wrote code and built
                        software.</p>
                    <p class="py-5">Now, if they promised you to become a "decent" or "good" or "hireable" or "junior"
                        software
                        developer, now that's a different story. In order to become any of the above, you should be able
                        to build/maintain/update GOOD software. And by good software, I mean software that actually has
                        users with a low churn rate. If they are willing to pay, even better. So what does it take to
                        become a "decent" or "good" or "hireable"
                        or "junior" dev? Can it be done in 6 months?</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Fundamentals of Programming vs Fundamentals of Computer
                        Science</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">The eternal debate. What do I teach my students first? Computer architecture, logic
                        gates, latches, flip-flops, multiplexers, clocks, datapaths, busses, registers, the ALU,
                        decoder, cache,
                        main memory,
                        microarchitecture, instruction sets, and assembly code? Or data types, ints, floats, booleans,
                        strings, characters, constants, variables, control flows, loops, functions, classes and objects?
                        The answer is: it depends.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-5">If your student is more inclined to learn the theory behind computer science, then
                        it makes sense to start by teaching them computer architecture, data communication, algorithms
                        and operating systems. They will be doing very little code, but their understanding of computing
                        will become excellent.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-5">But from my experience, it's better to teach them something more interactive.
                        Something they can write, and run, and see their code in action. Learning the theory can wait.
                        In fact, if they are passionate and motivated to become software engineers, they will naturally
                        be driven to learn <span class="italic">how</span> their code runs.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Curriculum</h2>
                    <p class="py-5">Spoiler alert: yes, you can become at least a decent, possibly hireable junior dev
                        in 6 months. Here's how:</p>
                    <p>You first teach them the fundamentals of programming. Learn Python because it's a loosely typed,
                        dynamically written interpretted language. Then, learn OOP with Java (I hate Java by the way),
                        and that way you learn strictly typed, statically written compiled code. And you also get to
                        experience object-oriented programming shoved down your throat because you have no other choice
                        with Java. What a bliss for functional programmers. Then, you teach them procedural programming
                        with C. Welcome to bit manipulation, pointer manipulation, memory manipulation, data structure
                        and segfault hell.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-5">I'm just kidding, don't teach them C yet. They're not ready for that. Unless you
                        want to be mean. You really should teach them HTML and CSS for the joy of frontend development
                        and seeing your code colorfully decorate your screen. Then, teach them JavaScript. This should
                        be a bliss after learning Java. Your student is now ready to learn React. Frameworks, and a
                        gazillion npm packages, yay! You
                        might as well teach them Tailwind here. Then comes backend development. Choose your poison.
                        Flask, Django, Spring Boot, Gin Gonic, ASP.Net, Node, Express, they all fly. Be careful! You
                        also want to make sure they understand SQL (and MongoDB if you want, I guess).
                    </p>
                    <p>Your student is now a full stack developer! They can build and deploy CRUD apps,
                        possibly even
                        having mastered authentication. But let's face it, this is not enough. Neither their frontend
                        nor their backend can be considered "decent".
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-5">You really want them to master modern, blazingly-fast, safe technology. Show them
                        the
                        ropes around using advanced libraries and frameworks. Get them to start using Linux
                        distributions. Get them to use TypeScript, no more JS. Move them away from Node onto Bun.
                        Create-react-app?
                        no, no, Tanstack router and
                        query. Hono. Zod. End-to-end safety using a monorepo. This is how you get them to become decent
                        developers. You now want them to build advanced applications, like instant messaging using web
                        sockets, binary file handling with s3. You might even consider UDP for voice calls and video
                        calls. Add a sprinkle of UI/UX design knowledge for good measure.
                    </p>
                    <p>But wait. Your student is very good at programming, but they have no understanding of computer
                        science. So now, it's time to teach them computer architecture, data communication, TCP, OSI,
                        algorithms and operating systems. And thus, they are now ready to dive into C and all of its
                        goodness.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-5">It's now time for your student (or you) to start building programs. The learning is
                        now over (unless you want to deepen your knowledge in science or another specialized field of
                        expertise to apply to your application). It's now time for them to apply their skills and build
                        their portfolio. They have the talent to dig deeper in any specialization they wish, be it HCI,
                        embedded programming, frontend, backend, full stack, or game development. You can even teach
                        them to improve DX by, for example, teaching them Vim Motions and Vim!
                    </p>
                    <p>Here is my full curriculum, if I can get the student to contribute 8 hours a day, 5 days a week,
                        for 24 weeks (6 months).
