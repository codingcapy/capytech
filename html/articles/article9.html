                    <img src="../image/ai.webp" alt="Some robot doing something" class="scrum-img mx-auto">
                    <p class="py-2 text-teal-300">Posted on: March 13, 2025</p>
                    <p class="py-5">Yet Another Article About AI (YAAAI). This is what this is. But not really.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are six well-known levels of "programming languages", so to speak, in computer
                        architecture. The lowest, level 0, is digital logic level, where you deal with logic gates and
                        bits. Then, you have microarchitecture level where you write commands for the CPU so it
                        manipulates memory and the ALU (PCout, MARin, READ, clear Y, set Cin, ADD, Zin etc). You also
                        have ISA, OS, and assembly above it. Finally, you have the problem-oriented level where every
                        programming language you can think of resides (Python, Java, C, C++, C#, Go, Rust,
                        JavaScript, Gleam...). And then you have level 6. This is where I would put "prompt engineering"
                        for
                        software development.</p>
                    <p class="py-5">Now here's the first issue: LLM prompts are just plain english. LLMs just take any
                        kind of text content (or nowadays image and video as well) input without any binding structure
                        or rules that need to be followed
                        and tries to understand it and
                        produce an output. And that's why it's great! Great for the general public, great for general
                        purpose. Not great for software development.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Introducing AI agents</h2>
                    <p class="">AI agents are given context. This context is written in a very specific way (You are a
                        highly skilled software developer...) and is prompted, or "engineered" in a way that the LLM
                        will behave in a
                        more desired way, for example, more like a software developer. It will (hopefully) produce
                        better
                        quality code than a simple "Make me a 2D platform adventure game in python" ChatGPT prompt. But
                        is
                        it good enough, as in good enough to build actual deployable apps and not prototypes? Good
                        enough to
                        replace software developers? At the time of writing with Claude Sonnet 3.7 deep think mode...
                    </p>
                    <p>No.</p>
                    <p class="py-2"></p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Structure, or The Lack Thereof</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">Every programming language has rigid syntax rules that must be adhered to, or the
                        compiler or interpreter will reject your instructions. When we're attempting to use LLMs to
                        produce code, we are literally attempting to use them as compilers from level 6 to level 5 or
                        lower. Neural nets take input, process the input, and produce output. The input currently has no
                        defined structure, and even with attempts at adding structure to AI agents, the english language
                        is
                        too vague. The "compiler" now has to deal with structureless input and somehow compile and
                        output it into
                        working level 5 code. This is a problem.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Levels of Abstraction</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">We are now hitting the wall of attempting to abstract level 5 code even further. And
                        here is my argument: plain english is simply too high of an abstraction to be considered level
                        6. My imagination of what a level 6 language that the AI compiler could compile and produce
                        working code output would look like something like this:</p>
                    <div class="bg-gray-900 p-2">
                        <code class="py-2">
                        1. <span class="text-blue-500">MODE</span> = development <span class="text-green-400">// tells the LLM to switch mode from general-purpose to specifically
                        development</span> <br>
                        2. <span class="text-blue-500">COMMAND</span> = build <span class="text-green-400">// tells the LLM that it will need to build a program. Other modes could
                        include DEBUG, TEST and DEPLOY</span> <br>
                        3. <span class="text-blue-500">STACK</span> = React, Hono, PostgreSQL <span class="text-green-400">// tells the LLM what stack to use</span> <br>
                        4. <span class="text-blue-500">OBJECTIVE</span> = game <span class="text-green-400">// this can be replaced by "website" or "tool" or a variety of objectives
                        for the program. This parameter is sensitive and has the risk of becoming too vague unless the
                        objective of the program input is crystal clear to the AI compiler.</span> <br>
                        5. <span class="text-blue-500">FRONTEND_DETAILS</span> = 2D, single-player, user controls main character, controls = [move, left,
                        right, jump,
                        double-jump, attack, dash, special attack], ui = [health bar, stamina, character level,
                        inventory, stage level, boss health bar], enemies = [mob1,
                        mob2,
                        mob3, mob4, mob5, boss1, boss2, boss3, boss4, boss5], checkpoints <span class="text-green-400">// again, can be extremely
                        sensitive
                        and complicated, ideally can provide the AI compiler design frames from something like Figma</span>
                        <br>
                        6. <span class="text-blue-500">BACKEND_DETAILS</span> = users, save progress, load progress <span class="text-green-400">// anything beyond CRUD operations will
                        become sensitive to input into the AI compiler</span>
                    </code>
                    </div>
                    <p class="py-2">Steps 4 and beyond are where the input must be carefully crafted for the AI compiler
                        to compile correctly and output working code. In fact, we should allow the AI compiler to
                        provide feedback such as syntax errors or logic errors at this stage. This is a level 6 language
                        because it no longer deals with data types and data structures (as much as possible, since we
                        still seem to need to
                        use something that looks like an array). There are no functions to be
                        defined or classes to be
                        declared explicitly. And obviously no memory management, no pointers. Like any compiler, the AI
                        compiler will
                        need to provide feedback or
                        clarifications
                        regarding potential gaps in information or error-causing inputs. If all of these are achieved,
                        we now have a level 6 language that uses AI as its compiler. But is this what people want?
                        Perhaps not. Because this still feels like coding. And people don't want to code or engineer,
                        for some reason. But they still want something that's engineered. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
