                        <p>Posted on: February 9, 2023</p>
                        <p>Scrum is a highly-disciplined agile framework focusing on time-boxed iterations called
                            sprints.</p>
                        <p>Let's start with a quick summary of the meaning of agile in tech. Agile is a philosophy and a
                            mindset.
                            It embraces change and continually adapts to change via constant communication and
                            adjustments. It is a product resulting from high rates of project failures that resulted
                            from the traditional waterfall method. Water does not flow upwards. The traditional
                            waterfall method and software
                            development lifecycle heavily scrutinizes a project prior to initiation via lengthy
                            requirements engineering and analysis
                            processes and sets a goal. It sets a concrete, rigid plan and does not deviate from that
                            plan. Projects can take several years to complete, and often little to no feedback is taken
                            from the customer during the project's development phase. Agile focuses on the customer's
                            needs not just during the initiation of the project but also throughout its development. It
                            did
                            not begin in the
                            tech industry and is not
                            restricted to tech. Notable academics such as Takaeuchi and Nonaka, Highsmith, Ambler,
                            Forrester, Sutherland, Schwaber, Beck, Cockburn, McConnell, Jeffries, and many others have
                            built on the foundations of agile. It is constantly responsive to change and moving targets.
                            This is not to say the waterfall method is obsolete today; many projects are more suited to
                            be
                            developed using the waterfall approach, especially those where the technology has matured
                            and
                            has been used several times in the past. Agile is best used in a bleeding edge environment
                            where requirements are uncertain.
                        </p>
                        <p>So what is scrum? It is a word borrowed from rugby. Its etymology derives from the rugby
                            scrum ceremony where players periodically gather close together and strategize their next
                            play. Scrum in
                            tech consists of sixth ceremonies; scrum planning, sprint planning, daily scrum, backlog
                            grooming, sprint
                            review, and sprint retrospective. The primary objective of scrum is to constantly adapt to
                            change via constant communication with the customer and across the team during the
                            development of the project
                            via these ceremonies. A scrum team only has three designated positions; a single product
                            owner, a single scrum master, and developers. The product owner may be the customer
                            themselves, or a specialist for the role that constantly communicates with the customer or
                            someone representing the customer. The
                            scrum master is a servant leader that facilitates team meetings, coaches team members and
                            other company staff about scrum, and
                            removes impediments. Developers may include software engineers, data architects, database
                            administrators, UI/UX
                            designers, testing specialists, and any team member that contributes to the output of the
                            project. A scrum team
                            must be less than ten members.</p>
                        <p>My curiosity began to stir as I delved deeper into the studies of the agile philosophy and
                            the scrum framework; could this perhaps be something that could be applied on a
                            psychological and individual level? How many individuals out there face difficulties because
                            they struggle to adapt to change in their personal lives, or are settling in a comfort zone
                            when they shouldn't be? Could this, perhaps, be a tool
                            that could be used outside of the business environment and be implemented on a more
                            personal, individual level? The more I thought about this, the more I began to realize this
                            could be a universal hidden gem that could potentially drive my life around, and not just
                            mine.
                            Believe me, I made several attempts to maintain checklists, calendar deadlines and whatnot
                            to stay ontop of tasks and stay motivated. None of them worked. They just felt ... banal?
                            boring? I
                            decided I should give this a try and began to test it. I knew from the get-go that I could
                            not replicate a "pure" scrum; I was certainly not a team of several people, and I had to be
                            my own product owner AND scrum master. But, I thought, I can deal with the latter two; I can
                            have internal conversations on a daily basis to stay ontop of my tasks, and I can perform
                            sprint planning, review, and retrospectives WITH myself, and I am familiar and educated with
                            the scrum
                            ceremonies; I can be my own coach and product owner (in the end, I knew best what my themes,
                            epics,
                            user stories, and user acceptance criteria were).
                        <p>And so I created my own personal Trello
                            board. I
                            sat down for a moment and began filling up my product backlog with epics and user stories. I
                            then prioritized them and added story points for each and added user acceptance criteria. I
                            moved the highest priority user
                            stories into the release backlog. And my first sprint iteration began with sprint planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>It would be an understatement to say that implementing scrum in my life resulted in
                            significant
                            changes. The level of focus and motivation resulting from this framework is unrivalled. Not
                            to mention the level of satisfaction in completing tasks. It is difficult to gauge the level
                            of productivity during the sprint, but in retrospect, I realized I had accomplished miles
                            more than if I had not used scrum. Mind you, I was not an unproductive person; I had daily
                            plans to which I did my best to abide by. But there were those tasks that I would place in
                            the backburner that I thought every day that I would get to eventually but never got to it
                            ; scrum makes it painfully clear that it is overdue. And that is the magic of scrum; it is
                            painful but rewarding. And you'll be thankful for it later.</p>

                        <p>Posted on: October 21, 2022</p>
                        <p>Tech with Tim is an amazing youtube channel that contains tutorials for various types
                            projects.
                            Tim Ruscica is a talented software developer whose tutorials are educative and highly
                            informative. Three weeks ago Tim uploaded a video titled "How NOT To Land A Developer Job".
                            In
                            the video, he talks about some examples of applications to his internship post (without
                            mentioning any names), where candidates declare that they "don't know" a certain language or
                            are
                            a "beginner". Tim cautions against using such language since as a recruiter he has to go
                            through
                            thousands of applications and is looking for candidates who are confident and "know what
                            they're
                            doing".</p>
                        <p>The following <a
                                href="https://www.opengrowth.com/resources/why-do-software-developers-suffer-from-imposter-syndrome"
                                target="_blank">article</a> discusses a phenomenon too well-known amongst software
                            developers called Impostor Syndrome. According to the article, due to the nature of the
                            constantly evolving tech
                            industry, developers tend to undervalue their skills and knowledge. As I studied and
                            developed
                            various apps and programs over the last two years, I realized how expansive and intricate
                            the
                            world of tech was; multiple programming languages with each their advantages and
                            disadvantages over each other, how they are used to achieve different tasks and different
                            software, differenet levels of language and how close they are to human or machine language,
                            front-end vs back-end knowledge and skills,
                            multiple fields including data science, systems architecture, network architecture, ML,
                            cybersecurity, and quantum computing.</p>
                        <p>As an individual who can design and build programs and software in different languages, and
                            also
                            as a person
                            who loves learning new things, I personally felt excited to learn everything and anything
                            about
                            almost all of those fields. The more languages I learn and the more programs I build, my
                            fascination for what a person or team can achieve with just a computer keeps on growing.
                            Like we all did at some point, I sometimes get stuck on one single bug for days, even weeks,
                            but
                            eventually a solution is found,
                            with a combination of online help and past experiences. And once you find and understand the
                            solution, that knowledge is yours forever, and you have just become a better programmer. The
                            key
                            is to continue to collect solutions to different problems until they become familiar, so
                            that
                            when you encounter a similar problem in the future, you have an idea about how to overcome
                            it.
