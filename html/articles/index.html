                    <p>Posted on: October 21, 2022</p>
                    <p>Tech with Tim is an amazing youtube channel that contains tutorials for various types projects.
                        Tim Ruscica is a talented software developer whose tutorials are educative and highly
                        informative. Three weeks ago Tim uploaded a video titled "How NOT To Land A Developer Job". In
                        the video, he talks about some examples of applications to his internship post (without
                        mentioning any names), where candidates declare that they "don't know" a certain language or are
                        a "beginner". Tim cautions against using such language since as a recruiter he has to go through
                        thousands of applications and is looking for candidates who are confident and "know what they're
                        doing".</p>
                    <p>The following <a
                            href="https://www.opengrowth.com/resources/why-do-software-developers-suffer-from-imposter-syndrome"
                            target="_blank">article</a> discusses a phenomenon too well-known amongst software
                        developers called Impostor Syndrome. According to the article, due to the nature of the
                        constantly evolving tech
                        industry, developers tend to undervalue their skills and knowledge. As I studied and developed
                        various apps and programs over the last two years, I realized how expansive and intricate the
                        world of tech was; multiple programming languages with each their advantages and
                        disadvantages over each other, how they are used to achieve different tasks and different
                        software, differenet levels of language and how close they are to human or machine language,
                        front-end vs back-end knowledge and skills,
                        multiple fields including data science, systems architecture, network architecture, ML,
                        cybersecurity, and quantum computing.</p>
                    <p>As an individual who can design and build programs and software in different languages, and also
                        as a person
                        who loves learning new things, I personally felt excited to learn everything and anything about
                        almost all of those fields. The more languages I learn and the more programs I build, my
                        fascination for what a person or team can achieve with just a computer keeps on growing.
                        Like we all did at some point, I sometimes get stuck on one single bug for days, even weeks, but
                        eventually a solution is found,
                        with a combination of online help and past experiences. And once you find and understand the
                        solution, that knowledge is yours forever, and you have just become a better programmer. The key
                        is to continue to collect solutions to different problems until they become familiar, so that
                        when you encounter a similar problem in the future, you have an idea about how to overcome it.
