                    <p class="py-2 text-teal-300">Posted on: November 17, 2024</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Recently I got hired at a tech startup as a founding software developer.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Myself and two others form a team of three full stack devs tasked to build a
                        generative AI web application from the ground up. Our CEO is a talented and battle-hardened UX
                        designer who provided us wireframes to build upon. We constructed the
                        frontend, webserver and database to create a working full stack web app that uses genAI over 9
                        sprints.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">As my team and I got down to business and started drawing flow diagrams and ERDs on
                        the whiteboard and churned out code, I started to realize something - virtually all the diagrams
                        I drew and the code I wrote came from my past projects. In fact, we would regularly refer back
                        to our past projects to bring in code snippets from them, be it API controller functions, state
                        management functions, or database queries. I got to thinking: what if I didn't spend all that
                        time outside of my classes to build my past projects?</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Today I'm here to primarily tell you why it's so, so important to build many
                        projects instead of just completing assignments for your course grades. That is not to say
                        ignore your course assignments - fundamentals of programming and computer science are important,
                        more on that later. But there is a reason why the best programs and applications were built by
                        college dropouts.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Programming is a Craft</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">One thing you should never forget is that programming languages are a tool and
                        programming is a craft. Just as performing surgery or building a chair, programming is a craft
                        to build software that solves problems or does something the user enjoys. No matter how enticing
                        it gets to learn about processors
                        and ALUs and memory management, if you can't build something from what you learn, it essentially
                        just becomes no more than a puzzle game or math problem. This is why whenever you learn
                        something, be it Python,
                        Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, PHP, Flask, or C#, you should try to build
                        something. Or several things.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Design, build, test, optimize</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">Engineering begins with an idea or goal. You take the idea, then you start designing
                        the architecture for it. Then, you use the design to build it using whatever stack you choose.
                        Then, you test, and if it breaks, you rectify. When everything is somewhat working, you
                        optimize. You now have a fully functioning program or application.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Deployment</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">You might think deployment is trivial. That is not the case. You want to see your
                        project come to fruition. You might brush that aside, shrug it off, but you will feel different
                        when your
                        application is actually exposed to the world. This is an experience that should not be ignored.
                        It helps you build confidence as a software developer and makes you feel accomplished, even if
                        you didn't make a single penny out of your project. You will come across all sorts of new
                        problems when you actually decide to deploy your software to the world.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Celebrate, Rinse and Repeat</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">You've deployed your first precious application or program - Congratulations! But
                        the journey
                        is only beginning. This is the start of the road in an incredible journey. Like I said before,
                        programming is a craft,
                        but it's an incredibly powerful craft
                        that can influence millions of people around the world, given the right idea, design, and build.
                        You've grown as much as the project you just deployed. Now, it's time to think about the next
                        idea, design it, build it, test it, optimize it, and release it. Or, it's time for you to add
                        more features to your current project.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">D-Day</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">There will come a time when you come across an incredible idea. I like to call it
                        D-day. It may or may not come from you. It may come from a CEO of a startup. It may come from a
                        friend or family or coworker. At this moment, you have to do your due diligence before
                        jumping into building - are there existing designs for the application? Remember, you are a
                        developer, not a designer. No matter how confident you are with design, there will be others who
                        are more talented than you. If you think your design is better, go with it. Otherwise, ask for
                        something. Then, check what the source has been doing so far regarding the product - have they
                        begun marketing? Is there presence for it? Is the structure for success established? If none of
                        those apply, you have to do the work yourself.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Time to Build</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">After you've established that there is a potential for great success from delivering
                        something significant to users, the time will come to build. And this is the time you will
                        realize all the apps and programs you've built so far will be your ally. Every second you spent
                        designing, building, fixing, and optimizing, will come into play. Of course, you will run into
                        blocks. But that's when your education will kick in - the more you understand the fundamentals
                        of programming and computer science, the faster you will find your answer. Your experience
                        building applications and your education will work in tandem. They will assist you in equal
                        amounts, be it consciously or not. If you did not spend time building things from what you
                        learned, it will take you that much longer to figure out a solution. But if you can remember
                        running into a similar issue from a past project of yours, you are that much faster, and that
                        much more valuable.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Build projects. Set time aside. The best chair builder didn't become the best
                        hand-crafted chair
                        builder by getting perfect scores in class. They built many, many chairs, and
                        optimized over and over again by learning from their past chairs. By the way, the most expensive
                        chair in the world costs $30 million dollars.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Let's make the world a better place.</p>
