                    <p class="py-5">How long does it take to get a six-pack? How long does it take to build physique?
                        How long does it take to become a sofware developer? Well, the answer is obvious. It depends.
                    </p>
                    <p>What is software development anyway? It's the iterative process of designing, building, testing,
                        and
                        optimizing programs and tools that solve problems. The process involves troubleshooting,
                        analyzing,
                        debugging, developing algorithms, storing, retrieving, managing, and deploying. And all of this
                        can't be learned in a single day.</p>
                    <p class="py-5">I've been programming for almost 4 years. I started in summer 2021 when I enrolled
                        in the applied software development certificate program at the British Columbia Institute of
                        Technology. Over the years, I completed a total of 3 programs, namely applied computer
                        information systems and applied web development programs ontop of the one mentioned above. I'm
                        also one
                        course away from completing the computer systems certificate program. I took
                        fundamentals of programming with Python, object-oriented programming with
                        Java, procedural programming with C, web dev with HTML CSS and JS, frontend with React, backend
                        with
                        Node,
                        relational database design with SQL, mathematics for computing, and right now I'm smack in the
                        middle of learning computer architecture and organization. I'm planning to take discrete math,
                        data communications, operating systems and algorithm analysis and design in the coming months.
                    </p>
                    <p class="">During my studies, I developed a ton of programs with the languages I learned,
                        namely a few 2D sprite games, a banking system, and lots of web apps including a reddit-like
                        social platform, a personal finance app, and a chat app. For every program I've built, I've
                        grown as much. That's how I got my software developer
                        job at a tech startup. You need to continuously build more and more complex programs and face
                        new challenges in order to grow as a software developer. You will also become more and more
                        confident in your skills and knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2"></p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">1000+ Hours?</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">When you look at coding bootcamps and see things like "become a developer in x
                        months", I think in my head "yeah, that's totally possible... if you program for 8+ hours per
                        day". Of course, it's not just programming, but also learning software development and
                        engineering best practices. It's just like working out: you want to train with proper form and
                        sufficient effort and achieve progressive overload while maintaining proper nutrition. You want
                        to learn the proper ways of developing software and the science behind it, the architecture, the
                        design, the process. If you dedicate 6 months at a bootcamp learning computer science while
                        programming for 8+ hours a day, that's roughly 1500 hours of quality coding and learning. It
                        just makes more sense to think of it in terms of hours than months. I did the rough math and I'm
                        pretty sure
                        I've been programming for 1500 hours. Considering that I rarely took a break from programming,
                        even if I had programmed for one
                        hour per day, which I've definitely dedicated multiple times that, I would be at
                        around 1500 hours. So yes, you can become a software developer in 6 months, theoretically, if
                        you do the right things for the right amount of time. For me, it took 4 years.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">Code First, or Computer Science First?</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">One of my coworkers at the coding academy I work at is deadset on teaching his
                        students computer architecture and operating systems first. Registers, busses, ALU, pipelines,
                        parity bits, instruction sets, assembly... I assume a lot of you would agree
                        with his approach. I beg to differ. I teach my students how to code in Python first. I teach
                        them everything including OOP. Then I tell them the importance of type safety and languages like
                        Java and C. I don't teach them C until they've learned HTML, CSS, JS, TS, React and Node. Then,
                        I teach them computer architecture and OS. Finally, I teach them C. It's not too late to learn C
                        at this stage, in fact it's easier and less gruesome than learning it as a first or second, or
                        even third
                        language. That's roughly how I learned computing, and that's how I teach as an instructor.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-xl pt-2 text-teal-300">What About the Stack?</h2>
                    <p class="py-2">If you've learned the fundamentals of programming, you'll then probably wonder what
                        stack you
                        should master. It really depends on what software you want to develop. I thrive in full stack,
                        so I
                        use Typescript, React with Tanstack router and query, Node with Hono paired with zod and
                        postgreSQL while
                        using Bun and Ubuntu. In fact, this is the stack we use at the tech startup I work at. Yes, I
                        have two jobs because I'm a pleb. We're
                        currently
                        building a prototyping tool that uses generative AI. Whatever the
                        stack, just make sure you like it, because you will be spending lots and lots of hours, perhaps
                        months and years, on them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">The most important takeaway is that you need to dedicate thousands, if not tens of
                        thousands of hours to programming and learning computer science and software development. There
                        is, in fact, no easy and quick way. CHOOSE YOUR HARD. The Primeagen mentioned. Sort of. So after
                        all this, if you've decided to come along for the
                        ride, buckle up,
                        because
                        it's going to get rough... but also fun :) <br>
                        ... sometimes.
