                <img src="../image/banking-sys-python.jpg" alt="Banking System Prototype II"
                    id="banking-sys-protoype-img">
                <p>This project is a banking system prototype program written using object-oriented programming in
                    Python.</p>
                <p>The user can create instances of the Profile and Account class objects that are stored in arrays and
                    saved into csv files at program termination, and are retrieved and parsed into their appropriate
                    objects before being appended into their appropriate arrays at program launch.
                </p>
                <p>The user can also modify attributes of the Profile class object instances via an edit feature, and
                    can deactivate profiles and accounts by manipulating their status attributes. </p>
                <p>The display feature allows the user to display profiles in sorted order by the attribute of their
                    choice.</p>
                <p>The search feature allows the user to search a profile by an attribute of their choice that qualifies
                    as the primary key.</p>
                <p>Transactions such as deposit, withdrawal and funds transfer between accounts can be performed by the
                    user by calling the appropriate functions using appropriate program features.</p>
                <p>All search, funds transfer and deactivation features use TimSort to sort the array and uses binary
                    search to
                    search for the profile or account in order to reduce time complexity.</p>
                <p>Every feature is safe-guarded in terms of data type input validation.</p>

                <img src="../image/art-gallery-web-app.jpg" alt="Art Gallery Web App" id="art-gallery-img">
                <p>This is a web app I developed for a talented artist who wanted her customers to be able to browse her
                    shop at conventions without necessarily having to wait near her booth physically to look at her
                    products.</p>
                <p>Stack used is HTML5, CSS3, and JS ES6.</p>
                <p>There are a total of 10 categories and each can be
                    expanded and collapsed on click/tab. The background color changes and the pointer rotates 108
                    degrees.</p>
                <p>The end user can scroll horizontally to browse through products under each category. The
                    screen auto-scrolls to the location at which the user tapped the category, and the "to-top" button
                    appears on the lower right once the user scrolls down the page and disappears as the screen
                    approaches the top of the page.</p>

                <h3>Banking System Prototype</h3>
                <img src="../image/banking-sys-prototype.jpg" alt="Banking System Prototype"
                    id="banking-sys-protoype-img">
                <p>Having worked for a financial institution for the past 7 years, I have decided to make a personal
                    project of building a banking system prototype that also functions as a CRM.</p>
                <p>This prototype uses Java WindowBuilder library to render a graphical user interface. It initializes
                    with a login window consisting of username and password labels and textfields, as well as a forgot
                    password edge case button which prompts the user to enter an email address in order to send them a
                    temporary password.</p>
                <p>Once the user logs in, the home frame is called and the login window is disposed. The user can search
                    for a profile by various means and can also display all existing profiles to choose from. The user
                    can
                    also create a new profile.</p>
                <p>When the user accesses a profile, the profile dialog is called, containing the first name, middle
                    name, last name, date of birth, phone number, address, and email address of the client. These fields
                    are locked until the user presses the 'Edit' button whereby they can modify the data and save it.
                </p>
                <p>The profile dialog also contains a list of all the accounts the client has and an account can be
                    selected to perform transactions such as withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds. The user can also
                    create and delete accounts.</p>
                <p>The user can also add notes into the client's profile.</p>
                <p>The data is contained in csv files which are loaded into the program at launch and all changes saved
                    as the
                    program is closed.</p>
                <p>This project is by no means finished; I have ambitious plans of adding more features such as credit
                    cards, mortgages, lines of credits, home equity lines of credits, and term deposits.</p>

                <h2>GameProjects</h2>
                <p>The following are game dev projects I have worked on by myself (I never consider them 100% finished,
                    the more time and effort put into a project, the better it gets)</p>
                <p>Therefore I always call them prototypes until they are actually shipped or in beta-test phase</p>
                <h3>Game Projects using Python Pygame Library</h3>
                <h4>2D ARPG Project</h4>
                <video src="../video/capy-game-design3.mp4" controls class="video"></video>
                <p>This is actually my third game development project, all written in Python and using the pygame
                    library. This project taught me animations, screen scrolling, and tile generation. This is still a
                    work in progress, and I am still adding features and working on balancing.</p>

                <video src="../video/capy-game-design1.mp4" controls class="video"></video>
                <p>This is my second game development project, fully written in Python and using the pygame library. I
                    learned to procedurally generate enemies through this project. I am considering adding more features
                    such as loot drops, upgrades, and boss addition in the future.</p>
